# InstaPay – Android app

It is an Android app that makes shopping a much better experience. It allows user to select the vendor where he wants to go and shop. Then user can go to the vendor and scan barcode of the products that he wants to buy, thus a list will be created, of all the products that the user scanned. Now he can review the list, edit it or proceed to checkout and pay for it right from the app. He will also receive a receipt of the payment inside the app itself which he can download as PDF or keep it in cloud. User can also find his purchase history anytime in the app. Managing his payment methods is easy too.

APIs used
 • Camera2 API – to allow user to click barcode of products
 • Google Barcode API – to detect and decode the barcode
 • Retrofit – for secure and stable network connections with remote server
 • Stripe – for validating payment details and generate token to process payment
